## 2026-02-05 — [DSA] Dijkstra's Algorithm
**Difficulty:** Advanced

Dijkstra finds shortest paths in weighted graphs with non-negative edges.

🔗 Reference: https://leetcode.com/problems/network-delay-time/

## 2026-02-06 — [System Design] CAP Theorem
**Difficulty:** Advanced

CAP theorem states distributed systems can't guarantee all three: Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance.

## 2026-02-07 — [AI] Fine-tuning vs Prompt Engineering
**Difficulty:** Beginner

Fine-tuning updates model weights on task-specific data, while prompt engineering crafts input instructions to elicit desired behaviors without changing weights.
